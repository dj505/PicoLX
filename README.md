# Required Footprint Libraries
If you want to fork this project, you can find the footprint libraries required to do so here.
* [Raspberry Pi "Minimal" RP2040 files](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/Minimal-KiCAD.zip)
* [ai03's MX V2 footprints](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_V2) (Cloned as submodule)
    * For the actual PCB footprints
* [ai03's MX Alps Hybrid footprints](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid) (Cloned as submodule)
    * For the schematic symbols, as they're not part of the V2 library
* [marbastlib keyboard parts](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib)

# Bill of Materials
Just the weird stuff I need to remember specific part numbers for until I can finalize the BOM
